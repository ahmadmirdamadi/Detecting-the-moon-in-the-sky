# Detecting-the-moon-in-the-sky

This code executes a series of commands to train an object detection model called YOLOv5. This model is trained to recognize the moon in images.

- First, required libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch are installed.
- Then the YOLOv5 model repository is received from GitHub and the necessary commands to install the requirements are executed.
- After that, training images are received from a Roboflow account and the model is trained using this data.
- Finally, using Tensorboard, the training process and recognition results are evaluated.

The last commands are used to detect the moon in a test image and display the results.
With this code, the moon can be detected in the sky by cameras. You can save the model and write a code that is connected to the webcam and can detect the moon.
